Recently, I have been interested in creating my own keyboard. This would allow me to position various keys in the way I like them and give me a learning opportunity for circuit design, KiCAD, and the like.

The design that really got me hooked was the [Sofle Keyboard](https://josefadamcik.github.io/SofleKeyboard/). I really liked the ergonomics of a split keyboard design, the OLED panel for simple data, and the potentiometer.

I saw this design from a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/j2tv4u/hello_lads_im_back_with_an_update_on_my/) by [u/apprecihate](https://www.reddit.com/user/apprecihate/) and fell in love.

Since then, I have been doing research on designing a custom keyboard and found some more interesting designs to reference. This design is called the [ErgoDash](https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash) and really like the key placement for the `ctrl` and `alt` keys.

### My design
Even though I really liked these two they each had one thing or another that I did not like. For the Sofle Keyboard, I really disliked that the `ctrl` and `alt` keys were unaccessible from my pinky in the usual location. And with the ErgoDash, I did not like that it did not have the OLED panel and the rotary encoder button. After giving it some thought, I came up with a set of requirements that I would like my new keyboard to have. I also decided to call my new keyboard **Dusk Keyboard** because I wanted to have a purple color scheme (If its not very apparent, purple is my favorite color). Also will name the respective macropad: **Dusk Macropad**. Since a macropad/numpad is simply a Ten-key "keyboard" I will refer to it interchangeably depending on the context. 

#### Dusk Keyboard
 - `ctrl`, `alt` key must be in the pinky cluster
 - No `caps` key. Replace with `esc` key 
 - `win`/`super` key must be be in the thumb cluster
 - Contain rotary dial for analog control
   - Can be reassigned in software to volume, etc
 - 3 layers
 - OLED Panel
 - Must contain all the keys in a TKL (Ten-key less) keyboard
   - Design a separate macropad/numpad
  - Cherry MX keys
    - Must be hot-swappable
  - Must look aesthetic (dusk/purple color scheme)
  - Use [QMK](https://qmk.fm/#/)
    - Too much of a hassle to write custom firmware

And with that, I will be posting follow up posts about the development of this keyboard and macropad. I will be posting a final post once everything is finished and working as a one stop read all guide to the design.
